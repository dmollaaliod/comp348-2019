    "# Assignment 1 - Python for Text Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission deadline: Friday 15 March 2019, 11:00pm*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of this assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will practice with the use of Python for text processing. You will be asked to implement tf.idf and cosine similarity from scratch. Normally you would use packaged libraries that implement these, and the lecture notes show how to use some of them. But in this assignment you are asked to implement them without using these libraries. This way you will achieve a better understanding of the mechanics of tf.idf and cosine similarity, and you get to practice with programming in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline of this assignment is before census date, so it can serve as a diagnostic test and you can determine if you want to remain in the unit or withdraw without penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the questions of this assignment. They are in the format of a Jupyter notebook so that you can use this notebook to work on your solution. Write the final solution in a standalone Python file as described in the \"submission\" section by the end of these assignment specifications."

    "## Submission\n",
    "Submit a single Python file with the solutions to all the questions. We provide a template defines all the functions as stubs. Make sure that you do not change the names and argument structure of the functions, since the submission will use an automatic marker that relies on these exact names and argument structure. The template we provide includes a few simple tests using [Python's doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) environment. These tests are there to help you, but note that we may use a separate set of tests when we assess your submission. It is your responsibility to run your own tests, in addition to the doctests provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission must be a single Python file. Do not submit several files or a zip file since the automarker would not know what to do with your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the deadline is a hard deadline and there will be a penalty of one mark per day of late submission. In addition, since the submission date is less than a week before the census date of 21 of March 2018, late submissions might not be assessed before census date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that **the work submitted should be your own work**. You may be tempted to search the Web for Python implementations of the questions asked in this tutorial. Be aware that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we find out that your work is copied from the Web or from other submissions, you may face disciplinary action.\n",
    "2. Often, trying to adapt work from the web may be more difficult than when you try from scratch.\n",
    "3. The work you find on the web may be wrong or not do exactly what is asked in this assignment anyway."
